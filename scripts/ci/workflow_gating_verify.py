"""Assert that job gating in .github/workflows/*.yaml is falsifiable.

Every check here corresponds to a defect this repository actually shipped, each
of which presented as a permanently `skipped` job rather than as an error. That
is the whole point: a broken gate is invisible in the run summary, so it has to
be caught by an assertion instead of by review.

  C1  folded-scalar `if:` that swallows the expression
  C2  skip propagating past an always() job into a downstream job without one
  C3  always() without a result assertion on each upstream
  C4  needs.<x> referenced in an `if:` but not declared in needs:
  C5  a script invoked bare from `run:` without the exec bit set in git

Exit 0 = all pass. Non-zero = at least one violation, listed on stderr.
